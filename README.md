> KaiOS UI Component for Vue (developing, need help)

This project is port from [AdrianMachado/KaiUI](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI) React library. After we develop similar features we will branch from it and work on custom components similar to components mentioned in this [style guide](https://developer.kaiostech.com/design-guide/ui-component).

This code is **NOT** production ready and is in early stages of development.

**Project development is slow, we need help.**

## Build Setup
You need vue-cli and some experience with nodejs.
``` bash
npm install
vue-cli-service serve
```

## TODO List

General:
- [x] Switch SASS/SCSS to LESS or change SASS package. (I don't like `node-sass` package)
- [x] LESS exporting variables to use dynamically in components. (maybe there is a better way using webpack, need help)

Components which are complete but still need polish or heavy testing:
- [x] ArrowListItem
- [x] BodyTextListItem
- [x] Button
- [x] Header 
- [x] IconListItem
- [ ] RadioButtonListItem
- [x] CheckboxListItem
- [x] Separator
- [ ] Slider
- [ ] SoftKey (need help)
- [ ] Tab
- [ ] TextInput
- [x] TextListItem

Views:
- [ ] ListView
- [ ] TabView
- [ ] GridView
